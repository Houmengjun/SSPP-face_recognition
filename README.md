# Single Sample Per Person Face Recognition
Matlab demo code for the article: Single Sample Face Recognition by Sparse Recovery of Deep-learned LDA Features

## Usage
Open Matlab and run the script

```
demo.m
```

This will automatically load the data file, which contains the preprocessed images of a subset (50 subjects) of the Labeled Faces 
in the Wild Dataset (LFW). The 50 subjects were randomly choosen from the 1680 that have at least 2 images. Two images for each 
subject were retained for this demo: one for gallery and one for testing.
